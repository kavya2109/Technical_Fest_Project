<p><h3><b>Spell Bee is to check students’ knowledge of spelling, to assess their vocabulary, and to identify their correct English usage for a lifetime.</b></h3></p><br>
<p><h3><b>PARTICIPATION: INDIVIDUAL (EVERY ROUND)</b></h3></p><br>
<p><h3><b>Round 1: Written<br>A Questionnaire with 20 questions will be provided for each contestant. Based on the cut-off and the number of participants, the contestants for the second round will be decided.<br>Round 2: Oral<br>The Pronouncer will pronounce a word very slowly and clearly. Then, the contestant should spell the word correctly. He can ask for meaning or definition if necessary to understand the word. The contestant will be given 2 minutes for spelling the word. The contestants with the highest score will be promoted to the last and final round.<br>
Round 3: Audio-Visual<br>
Here, the contestant will be shown a picture/video, then she has to guess the word correctly and spell it. The contestant will be given 2 minutes for spelling the word.<br>
RULES:<br>
<ol><li>The Spelling Bee Competition may be conducted orally or in writing or in a manner that is a combination of the two.</li>
<li>We, the SVECW, will be responsible for selecting the word lists that will be used. These lists will include only words that appear in the Oxford Dictionary.</li>
<li>The pronouncer will make every effort to pronounce the words according to the Oxford Dictionary.</li>
<li>The Oxford Dictionary shall serve as the final authority for the spelling of words. If more than one spelling is listed for a word, any of these spellings will be accepted as correct if the word either matches the pronunciation and definition provided by the pronouncer or it is clearly identified as being a standard variant of the word that the speller has been asked to spell.</li>
<li>In competition, after the pronouncer gives the speller a word, the speller may be encouraged to pronounce the word both before and after spelling it, but the judges shall not disqualify a speller for failing to pronounce the word correctly.</li>
<li>Results will be announced at the respective help-desk.
</li><li>Judge’s decision is final.</li></ol>
